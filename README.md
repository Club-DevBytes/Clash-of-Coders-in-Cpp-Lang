# Question -2

Vishwash is giving multiple choice exam. The exam consists of N multiple-choice questions numbered 1 through N. In each question, Chef may choose one out of four choices: A, B, C and D, or leave the question unanswered.

  

Answering a question correctly gives Vishwash 1 point. Not answering a question or answering it incorrectly gives him 0 points. However, there is a penalty for wrong answers. Specifically, the questions are graded one by one from question 1 to question N; for each i (1‚â§i‚â§N‚àí1), if Chef answered the i-th question incorrectly, his answer to the next question (the (i+1)-th question) is discarded without being graded. If an answer is discarded, Chef gets 0 points for it automatically, but even if it was wrong, the next answer is not discarded. There is no penalty for answering the last question incorrectly or for not answering some questions.

  

You are given the correct answers to all N questions and Vishwash's answers. Calculate the total number of points Vishwas scored on the exam.

  

**Input**

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.

The second line contains a single string S with length N. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string denotes the correct answer to the i-th question.

The third line contains a single string U with length N. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string is 'N' if Chef did not answer the i-th question; otherwise, it denotes Chef's answer to this question.

**Output**

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ‚Äî Chef's score.

**Example Input**
